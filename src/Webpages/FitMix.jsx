With Fitmix, I set out to simplify this process by creating a mobile app prototype that lets users snap photos of their clothes and get fresh outfit inspirationâ€”right from their closet."

The goal was to create a visually engaging and user-friendly experience that encourages personal style exploration and more intentional fashion choices."
